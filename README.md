# Django Bookmarks app [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/zsolthajdu/django_bookmarks.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/zsolthajdu/django_bookmarks)

Django app to store and access website bookmarks.
* Uses the [Django Rest framework](http://www.django-rest-framework.org) to provide a REST api.
* Uses the [Django Tagging](http://django-tagging.readthedocs.io/en/develop/) app to provide tagging of bookmarks.
  
Currently only supports basic functionality: adding bookmark urls and tags that are associated with tags.
